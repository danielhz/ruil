First download the code from the repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/danielhz/ruil.git

This project uses jeweler to build the gem, so you can use this commands:

    $ rake build            # to build the gem
    $ rake install          # to build and install the gem in one step

Also, if you want test the gem you can use the spec task:

    $ rake spec

This project uses rcov so you can check the coverage opening the HTML
file in the coverage directory after running the spec.
